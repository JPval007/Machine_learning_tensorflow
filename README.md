# Machine_learning_tensorflow
During this project, the main objective was to describe TensorFlow-based machine learning networks using Keras.
To achieve that, I implemented simple regression and classification algorithms, based on neural networks, using the combination of TensorFlow and Keras.

As practical examples, I solved the dog and cat image classification problem as well as the cost prediction for used cars in the UK by using the previous technologies.
